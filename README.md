# Alertra
Alertra is a system that is made to detect the drowsiness of a driver. It utilizes advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, developed with OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pygame, and Keras. By analyzing facial features and movements, the system can detect signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure. Once drowsiness is detected, an immediate alert is triggered, helping the driver stay awake and focused on the road. The blend of machine learning and real-time interaction ensures a reliable and responsive solution to enhance road safety and reduce the risks associated with fatigued driving.
